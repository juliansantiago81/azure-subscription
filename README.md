This is pretty much a mental preview of the structure of what we will be creating once everything has been set up. So when we first be set up our free account the platform will create what is called a "Tenant" which is essentially a representation of your organization. Once that is created, we will create a subscription. You can create multiple ones if you like, for instance if you have different departments to segregate costs if each department has their own budget. In this tutorial we will be creating just one.
