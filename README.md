<h1>Microsoft Azure Subscription Tutorial</h1>
In this tutorial, we will be signing up for a free 30 day ($200 credit) subscription to Microsoft Azure. Azure is a cloud computing platform with over 200+ set of services offered by Microsoft. It provides companies and individuals with a range of cloud based solutions such as virtual machines, storage, data bases, networking, and analytics. Users can run their apps, store their data, and host their websites within the platform. It also includes tools for developers to build, test, and deploy apps across a variety of programming languages and frameworks.<br />


<h2>Requirements</h2>

- Computer with Internet Connection
- Credit Card (Required for $200 free Azure credits for 30 days, then it's a pay as you go subscription. You will only get charged by what you use)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10

<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>

This is a mental preview of the structure of what we will be creating once everything has been set up. When we first set up our free account, the platform will create what is called a "Tenant" which is essentially a representation of your organization. Once that is created, we will create a subscription. You can create multiple ones if you like. For instance, if you have different departments with their own budget, you can create a subscripton to segregate costs but in this tutorial we will be creating one. Inside of the subscription, you can have one or more resource groups which act like folders to hold resources that you create such as virtual machines, databases, and storage accounts. Inside our resource group, we will be creating an Azure Storage Account. Think of it as a Google Drive or a Dropbox with more capabilities.

For **Subscription**, just leave it alone since we are just creating one in this tuturial. **Resource group** will be named *RG-Lab-01* in this exmaple, but you can name it whatever you like. For **Region**, you can choose the one that you're currently living in. Click **Next**. We don't have to specify **Tags** if you don't want to. Used for organizations to keep track of certian resources. Click **Review + create**

- Next we will be creating a storage accounts. > Create Storage Account > Subscription: Leave it alone > Resource Group: RG-Lab-01 > Storage Lab Name: Unique Name ie (JulianCourseCareersLab01) > Region > Redundancy: GRS (Resarch if needed) > Review + Create > Create > Got to Resource > Verify
- Step 4
